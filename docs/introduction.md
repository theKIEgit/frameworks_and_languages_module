Module Overview
---------------

<sub>Hint: Take notes .... seriously! ... get a notepad, or open a text document. Get ready!</sub>

TASK: (10min) 
* Find - the module handbook - read
* Whiteboard - What do you think is in this module?

## Module Aims
To develop the student’s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

### Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

Whiteboard in half: words to describe (10min)
* What is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)?
* What is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)?

The sign of an amateur:
> _TECH_XYZ_ is rubbish
This module will help develop an important part of your professional skill-set: 
* The ability to discuss and reason about technology choices

* The ability to use a professional toolchain (CI)
* Understand the basic elements of full stack web development


### Definitions

* Language
  * A formal structure to describe machine behaviour
* Framework
  * Inversion of control
    * It calls you, rather than you call it
* Tests
  * Automated
  * Document business requirements/spec
  * Document correct flow

### How will we learn

1. Focus on a business engineering problem with real industry tools
    * Hands-on each week with a range of tools
2. Discussion
    * Real engineers can discuss/reason about technology
    * Pair programming
3. Multiple languages
  * [langauge_reference.html](https://computingteachers.uk/static/langauge_reference.html)

#### Level 6
* Level 4 - You are told what to do
* Level 5 - Supported developing competency in a range of problem domains
* Level 6 - You are able to self direct (with support)

* My role is NOT to have all the answers
* My role is to facilitate your transition towards a skilled professional

Side Note: Employment. Popular languages? Less popular or new languages? Mark scheme 70%+

#### Session Overview - Online/Campus

Task: Look on blackboard at session list

* Each week
    * 09:00 - 13:00 Lab
    * 14:00 - 18:00 Supervised Workshop Support


Starting point Quiz (15min)
-------------------

How much do you as a class know already?
(They are deliberately challenging questions)

### Demo

Demo working server on gitpod
* https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module
```bash
make
make run_example_server_client
# https://8001-xxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io?api=https://8000-xxxxx.ws-eu67.gitpod.io
```
put link on blackboard - class interact

### Run it yourself (1 hour)

* Demo: (15min)
* Task: (30min)
* QA

<sub>Seriously ... make notes ... </sub>

* https://gitpod.io/ create account with GutHub login
* https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module

* Signup to GitPod
  * DO NOT use `vscode-latest` it's broken
  * GitPod -> Stop Container !important
  * GitPod -> Color Theme -> Dark+ (recommended)

Demo:
* Fork (description)
  * Allow CI
* The IDE
* The Interaction (public port)
* The tests
    make test_example_server
    make test_example_client
# download video
* GitPod shutdown and startup
  * 50 hours a month free
    * [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - 100 hours with cccu address + cccu id
