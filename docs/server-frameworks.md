Server Frameworks
-----------------

### Objectives
* Understand how to follow a tutorial to run "Hello World" for a range of server side frameworks
* Start to understand a range of server frameworks features
    * To justify your choice of server framework (assignment 2)

### Tasks for next week
1. Use a server framework + pass more tests
    * Explore a server framework on your own by attempting to follow a tutorial
    * Run "Hello World" server
    * Return a JSON response (e.g. `GET /test --> {"foo": "bar"}`)
    * Return a JSON response for Assignment 1 (e.g. `GET /items --> []`)
2. Attempt to write about a server framework features in `technical_report.md`

### This afternoon
* Full worked example of RSPV server in Express.js

### Next week
* Writing Workshop

History + Terms
---------------

* [REST: Representational state transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
    * > RESTful web APIs are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.
    * GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH
* [Common Gateway Interface (CGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)
    * Just drop a script in an executable folder (new process on each request)
* [Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface)
    * Connect web server (Apache, Nginx) to application logic (Python)
* [Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Server_Gateway_Interface)
    * [Difference between WSGI and ASGI?](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/difference-between-wsgi-and-asgi-807158ed1d4c)
* [Middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware)
    * Pre-request + Post-response hooks
    * Like _decorators_ (the language feature we looked at in the languages session)
* Traditional web applications - server templates
* [Single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
    * A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. 
* WebSockets
    * ongoing bidirectional connections - many server frameworks now support this
    * This is in addition to REST


Features of Server Frameworks
-----------------------------

Features probably needed for Assignment 1

* Routing
    * matching urls to functions/code
* Views
    * The logic of the application
* Data handling tools
    * Input - urlencoding, form encoding, json
    * Output - text, json, xml
* Middleware

Features probably not needed for Assignment 1

* Model - Datamodel (ORM)
* Templates
    * Rendering data into an html layout (on the server)
* Serializers (output data)
    * Streams
* Security/Authentication framework
* Websockets (realtime)
* Plugin or expansion framework



Server Frameworks
-----------------

Live coded examples


### Django (Python)


What is a server side framework?
Let's do a tutorial to find out what the components are.
(this is just to explore the further features - remember our goal for the assignment is to create a RESTApi to a spec)

* https://www.djangoproject.com/
    * Install Django
    * Tutorial Part 1 to Part 3
* Tutorial (first 3 parts)
* Let's live code!
    * https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-python-django

### Falcon Framework (Python)


* http://falconframework.org/
    * https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/quickstart.html

Let's build it in gitpod - livecode - containerize
* bind/host to `0.0.0.0` + explain

* https://www.fullstackpython.com/falcon.html
    * > Falcon is a WSGI-compliant web framework designed to build RESTful APIs without requiring external code library dependencies.

* https://impythonist.wordpress.com/2015/09/12/build-massively-scalable-restful-api-with-falcon-and-pypy/
    * > If you build a RESTFul API for some purpose, what technology stack you use in python and why?. I may receive the following answers from you.
      > 1)  I use Flask with Flask-RESTFul
      > 2)  I use (Django + Tastypie) or (Django + REST Framework)
      > Both options are not suitable for me. Because there is a very good light-weight API framework available in python called Falcon. I always keep my project and REST API loosely coupled. It means my REST API knows little about the Django or Flask project that is being implemented. Creating cloud API’s with low-level web framework than a bulky wrapped one always speeds up my API.



### Django REST Framework (Python)


https://www.django-rest-framework.org/

A framework, built on another framework

https://www.fullstackpython.com/django-rest-framework-drf.html
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/

* Web visible interface for exploration
* Pagination
* Multiple dateformat serializers
* Generates openAPI spec from working program



# ASP Core dotnet (c#)


* see `/examples/server/dotnet*`
    * My demo for building and running Microsofts demo TodoApi app in docker containers
1. build and run the example application
    * `http://localhost:5000/WeatherForecast`
2. Inspect the `TodoApi` folder
    * Try to identify the components of the web app
    * Look at the `Dockerfile`. Try to understand the steps it might be doing

### Snaic (python async)


* https://sanicframework.org/

1. Follow "Getting Started" and run the basic app
    * https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started
    * https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/basics/response.html#methods
    * https://sanic.dev/en/guide/deployment/development.html#cli
        * `--debug`
2. Add a response to the path `/test` to return the json `{"foo": "bar"}` - test with curl and browser
3. Build a docker container to run this
    * `Dockerfile`
        * ```Dockerfile
            FROM python:slim
            WORKDIR /app/
            RUN pip ???  ## Install dependencies/frameworks/libraries here ?? what did you install in Getting Started?
            COPY . .
            ENTRYPOINT ["???", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "server.app"]
            ```
        * (host/bind `0.0.0.0` is important for containers)
    * `Makefile`
        * ```Makefile
            DOCKER_IMAGE:=sanic_test
            build:
                docker build --tag {DOCKER_IMAGE} .
            run:
                docker run --rm -it --publish 8000:8000 ${DOCKER_IMAGE}
            ```

* https://www.fullstackpython.com/sanic.html
    * > Sanic is a Python web framework built on uvloop and designed for fast HTTP responses via asynchronous request handling. 
    * > Sanic cannot be developed or deployed on Windows due to its necessary uvloop dependency.
    * > There was an excellent discussion on the /r/python subreddit about using one of the newer async frameworks such as Sanic or Japronto compared with a traditional web framework like Django. 
      > One of the major tradeoff of adopting a newer framework is simply that the code library ecosystem has not, and may never, grow up around that framework. 
      > You have to accept the risk that you will need to build a significant amount of the plumbing yourself rather than pip installing existing, well-tested libraries.

### Express.js (javascript)

1. Create stub app

    * https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html
    * https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
        * `res.json()` https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.json
2. Add a response to the path `/test` to return the json `{"foo": "bar"}` - test with curl and browser
3. Create Container
    * Dockerfile
        * ```Dockerfile
            FROM node
            WORKDIR /app/
            RUN npm install ???  # what was the package?
            COPY *.js .
            CMD ["???", "app.js"]
            ```
    * Makefile
        * ```Makefile
            DOCKER_IMAGE:=express_test
            build:
                docker build --tag ${DOCKER_IMAGE} .
            run:
                docker run --publish 8000:8000 ${DOCKER_IMAGE}
            ```
    * Exiting from docker
        * ```javascript
            // Docker container exit handler - https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4182
            process.on('SIGINT', function() {process.exit()})
