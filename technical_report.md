Server Framework Features
-------------------------

### (Routing)
(Redo this gibberish)
The routing feature allows defined URL endings alongside specified http requests to be linked to a specific function, each route can have multiple http requests and therefore have multiple functionalities linked to a matched URL.

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to /hello
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello world')
```

Routing is beneficial as it enables us to create modular route handlers which is helpful for managing the structure of an application. The example above shows the response for /hello.

### (Middleware)
(Redo this gibberish)
Middleware are functions that have access to the req and res in an application, it is executed after the server receives a request and before a response is sent.
Express is constructed on multiple middleware functions stringed together.

```js
const exampleLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('LOGGED')
  next()
}

app.use(exampleLogger)
```
Above is a simple Express middleware that will print LOGGED when a request is passed through in this case the middleware has been assigned the name exampleLogger
